### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was about creating a system for managing driver training and vehicle registration. The client, Liam, wanted a system that supports online driving lessons, practice tests, and on-the-road training. The system needed to work both online and offline, integrate with DMV updates, and handle different user roles with appropriate access controls.

### What did you do particularly well?
I did a great job of aligning the system design with the client’s needs. My strengths were in gathering detailed requirements and creating clear design documents. This helped create a system that was easy to use and met the client's needs for managing data and tracking user activities.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to revise one documents in my project I would have to revise my system design document. I fell that their are better way for me to organize my existing UML diagram as well as activities I could have add like how the DMV interation would work.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I reviewed the interview document to gather the requirements and used them to design the system. Considering user needs is important because it makes sure the system works well for the users and meets their expectations.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by first gathering detailed requirements from users. I then create prototypes and refine them based on feedback. I focus on making the design user-friendly and test thoroughly to address any issues. In the future, I plan to continue using these methods and incorporate more data visualization and early user feedback to improve my design process.
